<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Natalia, and I am currently studying to become a web developer. 
  Transitioning to this new profession is a significant step for me, and I hope that I will find it fulfilling and that it will allow me to realize my potential.</p>

<p>Previously, I worked as a production planning engineer at a factory specializing in the manufacture of bulletproof vests, bulletproof glass, and other protective products. 
  This experience taught me to value precision, discipline, and responsibility in my work.</p>

<p>In my free time, I love to draw and create order out of chaos. Art is a way for me to express my thoughts and feelings, 
  while my passion for order reflects my appreciation for organization and a structured approach to tasks.</p>

<p>I enjoy watching TV series and movies as a way to relax and immerse myself in different worlds and stories. 
  Additionally, the sea, the sun, and traveling are sources of energy and inspiration for me. 
  I love exploring new countries, cities, and mountains, learning about different cultures, and collecting unforgettable experiences.</p>

<p>My goal is to successfully develop in the field of web development. 
  I am confident that acquiring new knowledge and skills will allow me to excel in this profession and find my place in the IT world.</p>
